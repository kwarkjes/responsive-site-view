            <p>This Chrome extension helps web designers do two things..</p>
            <p>Quickly preview responsive web designs at the dimensions they will be seen at on popular mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to grab an image for demonstration purposes and for use in portfolios.</p>
            <p>As well as enhancing the extension further, we're hoping to improve the device list. If there are any devices you think should be included or removed please contact us via <a href="http://nimbleworks.co.uk/contact-us" target="_blank">our website</a> or on <a id="feedback" href="http://twitter.com/nimbleworks" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that this extension does not emulate the devices listed. It simply renders websites via the Chrome browser at the specified dimensions. These are the dimensions a responsive website might appear at on the selected device, assuming it used something like the following meta element in the header:</p>
            <pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;</pre>
            <p>You will still need to test your website on lots of real devices. Why not start or contribute to a local device library? <a href="http://lab-up.org/" target="_blank">See LabUp! for more details..</a></p>
